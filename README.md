MySQL with C++
==============

A database system designed for a second-hand bookstore.

The system manages data on books, orders, customers, deliveries, purchases and store employees.

The system implements a basic textual user interface.

The interface displays a (numbered) list of actions.

The user types a number (of the requested action). The app picks up the number and identifies the requested action. Asks the user for additional details (if required) necessary to perform the operation.

The app performs minimal error checking.

After identifying the requested operation, and receiving all the details needed to perform the operation, the application will perform the operation (while of course, contacting DBMS MySQL).

The app will print the appropriate results.
